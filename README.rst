A Python3_ project template with several useful, standard, integrated
batteries included to help you to write clean, tested, quality code,
following the `Zen of Python`_.

If you are starting a Python3 project from scratch,
and you need to write robust and clean code,
this repository could help you.

What is and why *clean code* matters? Read `here`__.

__ CleanCodeArticle_

Requirements
------------

* Git_
* Python3_
* just_


Usage
-----

Setup
~~~~~

For development of CleanPython::

    $ git clone git@github.com:iacopy/cleanpython.git
    $ mv cleanpython yourprojectname

For a normal use for a custom project, just download the zip and use it as a skeleton.

Create a virtualenv. I suggest to use the fish console with virtualfish.
Otherwise, manually::

    $ virtualenv -p python3 ~/.virtualenvs/yourprojectname
    $ source ~/.virtualenvs/yourprojectname/bin/activate

First installation from scratch (assume to be on the repository root)::

    $ just start  # install last versions of requirements and check everything is ok

If something fails, try::

    $ just install  # use freezed requirements that are already checked

Optionally, you can also install the git hooks (further automatic checks)::

    $ just install-hooks


Minimal workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. write test first (TDD_)
2. write code until test pass
3. add your files to git index (e.g. ``git add -u``)
4. ``just commit <your commit message>``

When you launch ``just commit``, all your codebase is linted and tested before actually commit it.

In case of any fail, the commit is aborted.

For example:

* are there broken tests? Fail.
* are you trying to escape by avoiding to write tests? Fail.
* your function is too long? Fail.
* your class contains too much methods or attributes? Fail.
* your code is too complex? Fail.
* your code follows random style? Fail.

You don't want waste time committing broken code, isn't it?

Remember: prevention is better than cure.

Recipes
~~~~~~~


Make a complete code checkup (lint, test and coverage)::

    just check

The following are ``just`` recipes that are *not* called automatically
when you call ``just commit`` or ``just checkup``.

Run tests without coverage.py overhead::

    just test

Create and open your HTML test coverage::

    just cov

Create your HTML documentation::

    just doc

Run benchmarks (you have to write down them before :) )::

    just benchmarks

Remove build artifacts (i.e. all untracked files, pay attention!)::

    just clean


Just integrated tools
---------------------

- Pytest_
    - useful to write data driven tests
    - pytest-benchmark_ makes easy to compare different functions performances
- Hypothesis_
    - "property based testing"
    - really useful to find unexpected edge cases to test
- Mypy_
    - tests typing annotations
    - helps to find hidden bugs before they come up
    - NB: still experimental
- Coverage.py_
    - tells you which lines and branches are executed
    - a 100% coverage should be the *minimal* quality requirement
- Pylint_
    - the most complete python linter
    - with several complexity metrics it's useful to keep your code clean, simple and readable
    - helps you to start refactor before your code become too complex
- Flake8_
    - helps to write standard, clean and documented code
    - wraps pep8, pyflakes, McCabe Complexity analysis
    - supports plugins
- Sphinx_
    - produce html documentation
    - can auto-extract documentation from your codebase
- just_
    - rules them all together in your workflow
    - ``just commit MESSAGE`` allows you to commit only clean and tested code


Zen of Python
-------------

The highlighted lines are the ones that, mostly, ``CleanPython``
(**explicitly** or *implicitly*) tries to help to reach.

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
2. **Explicit is better than implicit.**
3. **Simple is better than complex.**
4. *Complex is better than complicated.*
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. **Readability counts.**
8. **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
9. *Although practicality beats purity.*
10. **Errors should never pass silently.**
11. *Unless explicitly silenced.*
12. *In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*
13. *There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.*
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. **Now is better than never.**
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
